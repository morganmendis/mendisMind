                    <p>The study of how people make choices. People make different decisions because of differences of capital (resources: money, time, etc.) and preferences(tastes, degree of optimism, previous experiences.)</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Rational agents - A user acts in a rational manner to maximize their utility from a decison;  a firm always aims to maximize profit.</li>
                            <li>Complete information - An agent has complete information; in an exchange both agents are expected to have the same amount of information.</li>
                            <li>Perfect competition  - There are many options for an agent; in a market there are many producers (i.e. supply meets demand so the price is in equilibrium)</li>
                            <li>No Barriers to competition - There are no obstacles that prevent an agent from acting on a new option; in business labor can move freely to new occupations or firms can enter an industry without impediment.</li>

                        <p>Health Economics attempts to understand and explains the decisions involved with a persons health. The field of health economics, particulary the positive analysis aspect of it, originated with the American economist Kenneth Arrow.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Normative: The way a health issue should be treated, to achieve an optimal outcome.</li>
                            <li>Positive: The way a decision regarding a health issue is actually made.</li>

                        <h3>Health economics is unique to other branches of applied economics.</h3>
                        <p>
                             Kenneth Arrow explained in his paper "Uncertainty and the Welfare Economics of Medical Care", that economics of medical care is a distinct field of economics. Arrow details several ways that the popular Competitive Model in economics is not sufficent to describe how medical care decisions are made or should be evaluated because several of the key assumptions fail to describe the nature of medical care.

                            Agents are not able to act rationally when their life or that of a loved one is in jeapordy.

                        <p>
                            The popular competitive models of supply and demand do not describe the economics of a healthcare systerm. In most sytems there is a shortage in the supply of medical care options. The demand for medical care is inelastic, the cost for medical care does not decrease the demand for medical care.

                        <h3>No Barriers to Competition</h3>
                        <p>There are many regulations, not everyone can provide medical care. The pharmatheutical industry cannot simply sell new drugs without government approval, also the use of patents allow for the development of monopolies.

                    <p>
                        In an attempt to rank decisions, there are several common methods to quantify the value of a decision.

                    <h3>Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA)</h3>
                    <p>
                        CEA relates costs to a single clinical or natural measure of effectiveness or the technical efficiency as it is difficult to compare treatments with different outcomes.

                    <h3>Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)</h3>
                    <p>
                         CBA relates costs to a valuation of benefits in commensurate (having a common or equal unit of measure), usually monetary, terms. It is one of the most popular tools in economics and is used across industries because of its ability to incorporate many dimensions in order to calculate value.

                    <p>
                        Cost-utility analysis relates costs to a multidimensional measure of effectiveness which takes into account the valuation of benefits.
